# plusMinus
[Problem](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/plus-minus/problem) from Hackerrank.
I was making the mistake of checking if the index was bigger or smaller than zero, instead of checking the value of the integer in that index. I was comparing <code>i</code> instead ,<code>arr[i]</code>.
